This program assumes that the “testData” folder will exist at run time and that you have python installed.
If you would like to run this program please use your command line to run the command:

python slcsp.py

The code will generate two outputs. One is to standard out (the command line).
The other is a file called “slcsp_updated.csv” which will be located in the same directory as this python script.
The outputs are the same but one my be easier to look at depending on your preference.
